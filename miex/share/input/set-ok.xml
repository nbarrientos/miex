BAHIA COCOA REVIEW
</TITLE>
<BODY>
Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone , alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao , although normal humidity levels have not been restored , Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review . The dry period means the temporao will be late this year . Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155 , 221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5 . 93 mln against 5 . 81 at the same stage last year . Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures . Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end . With total Bahia crop estimates around 6 . 4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6 . 2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers , middlemen , exporters and processors . There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining Bahia superior certificates . In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment . Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos . Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1 , 750 to 1 , 780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named . New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June July going at 1 , 850 and 1 , 880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july , Aug Sept at 1 , 870 , 1 , 875 and 1 , 880 dlrs per tonne FOB . Routine sales of butter were made . March April sold at 4 , 340 , 4 , 345 and 4 , 350 dlrs . April May butter went at 2 . 27 times New York May , June July at 4 , 400 and 4 , 415 dlrs , Aug Sept at 4 , 351 to 4 , 450 dlrs and at 2 . 27 and 2 . 28 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 4 , 480 dlrs and 2 . 27 times New York Dec , Comissaria Smith said . Destinations were the U . S . , Covertible currency areas , Uruguay and open ports . Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March April , 785 dlrs for May , 753 dlrs for Aug and 0 . 39 times New York Dec for Oct Dec . Buyers were the U . S . , Argentina , Uruguay and convertible currency areas . Liquor sales were limited with March April selling at 2 , 325 and 2 , 380 dlrs , June July at 2 , 375 dlrs and at 1 . 25 times New York July , Aug Sept at 2 , 400 dlrs and at 1 . 25 times New York Sept and Oct Dec at 1 . 25 times New York Dec , Comissaria Smith said . Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6 . 13 mln bags against the 1986 87 crop and 1 . 06 mln bags against the 1987 88 crop . Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27 . 3 ;
