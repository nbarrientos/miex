Editors Note
</TITLE>
<BODY>
This FYI RFC is a first attempt at providing Internet users guidance
on how to deal with security issues in the Internet.  As such, this
document is necessarily incomplete.  There are some clear shortfalls;
for example, this document focuses mostly on resources available in
the United States.  In the spirit of the Internets "Request for
Comments" series of notes, we encourage feedback from users of this
handbook.  In particular, those who utilize this document to craft
their own policies and procedures.

This handbook is meant to be a starting place for further research
and should be viewed as a useful resource, but not the final
authority.  Different organizations and jurisdictions will have
different resources and rules.  Talk to your local organizations,
consult an informed lawyer, or consult with local and national law
enforcement.  These groups can help fill in the gaps that this
document cannot hope to cover.

Purpose of this Work
</TITLE>
<BODY>
This handbook is a guide to setting computer security policies and
procedures for sites that have systems on the Internet.  This guide
lists issues and factors that a site must consider when setting their
own policies.  It makes some recommendations and gives discussions of
relevant areas.

This guide is only a framework for setting security policies and
procedures.  In order to have an effective set of policies and
procedures, a site will have to make many decisions, gain agreement,
and then communicate and implement the policies.

Audience
</TITLE>
<BODY>
The audience for this work are system administrators and decision
makers (who are more traditionally called "administrators" or "middle
management") at sites.  This document is not directed at programmers
or those trying to create secure programs or systems.  The focus of
this document is on the policies and procedures that need to be in
place to support any technical security features that a site may be
implementing.

The primary audience for this work are sites that are members of the
Internet community.  However, this document should be useful to any
site that allows communication with other sites.  As a general guide
to security policies, this document may also be useful to sites with
isolated systems.

Definitions
</TITLE>
<BODY>
For the purposes of this guide, a "site" is any organization that
owns computers or network-related resources.  These resources may
include host computers that users use, routers, terminal servers,
PCs or other devices that have access to the Internet.  A site may
be a end user of Internet services or a service provider such as a
regional network.  However, most of the focus of this guide is on
those end users of Internet services.

We assume that the site has the ability to set policies and
procedures for itself with the concurrence and support from those who
actually own the resources.

The "Internet" is those set of networks and machines that use the
TCP/IP protocol suite, connected through gateways, and sharing a
common name and address spaces [1].

The term "system administrator" is used to cover all those who are
responsible for the day-to-day operation of resources.  This may be a
number of individuals or an organization.

The term "decision maker" refers to those people at a site who set or
approve policy.  These are often (but not always) the people who own
Related Work

The IETF Security Policy Working Group (SPWG) is working on a set of
recommended security policy guidelines for the Internet [23].  These
guidelines may be adopted as policy by regional networks or owners of
other resources.  This handbook should be a useful tool to help sites
implement those policies as desired or required.  However, even
implementing the proposed policies isnt enough to secure a site.
The proposed Internet policies deal only with network access
security.  It says nothing about how sites should deal with local
security issues.

Scope
</TITLE>
<BODY>
This document covers issues about what a computer security policy
should contain, what kinds of procedures are need to enforce
security, and some recommendations about how to deal with the
problem.  When developing a security policy, close attention should
be made not only on the security needs and requirements of the local
network, but also the security needs and requirements of the other
interconnected networks.

This is not a cookbook for computer security.  Each site has
different needs; the security needs of a corporation might well be
different than the security needs of an academic institution.  Any
security plan has to conform to the needs and culture of the site.

This handbook does not cover details of how to do risk assessment,
contingency planning, or physical security.  These things are
essential in setting and implementing effective security policy, but
this document leaves treatment of those issues to other documents.
We will try to provide some pointers in that direction.

This document also doesnt talk about how to design or implement
secure systems or programs.

Why Do We Need Security Policies and Procedures?
</TITLE>
<BODY>
For most sites, the interest in computer security is proportional to
the perception of risk and threats.

The world of computers has changed dramatically over the past
twenty-five years.  Twenty-five years ago, most computers were
centralized and managed by data centers.  Computers were kept in
locked rooms and staffs of people made sure they were carefully
managed and physically secured.  Links outside a site were unusual.
Computer security threats were rare, and were basically concerned
with insiders: authorized users misusing accounts, theft and
vandalism, and so forth.  These threats were well understood and
dealt with using standard techniques: computers behind locked doors,
and accounting for all resources.

Computing in the 1990s is radically different.  Many systems are in
private offices and labs, often managed by individuals or persons
employed outside a computer center.  Many systems are connected into
the Internet, and from there around the world: the United States,
Europe, Asia, and Australia are all connected together.

Security threats are different today.  The time honored advice says
"dont write your password down and put it in your desk" lest someone
find it.  With world-wide Internet connections, someone could get
into your system from the other side of the world and steal your
password in the middle of the night when your building is locked up.
Viruses and worms can be passed from machine to machine.  The
Internet allows the electronic equivalent of the thief who looks for
open windows and doors; now a person can check hundreds of machines
for vulnerabilities in a few hours.

System administrators and decision makers have to understand the
security threats that exist, what the risk and cost of a problem

Basic Approach
</TITLE>
<BODY>
Setting security policies and procedures really means developing a
plan for how to deal with computer security.  One way to approach
this task is suggested by Fites, et. al. [3, FITES]:

This handbook will concentrate mostly on the last two steps, but the
first three are critically important to making effective decisions
about security.  One old truism in security is that the cost of
protecting yourself against a threat should be less than the cost
recovering if the threat were to strike you.  Without reasonable
knowledge of what you are protecting and what the likely threats are,
following this rule could be difficult.

Organization of this Document
</TITLE>
<BODY>
This document is organized into seven parts in addition to this
introduction.

The basic form of each section is to discuss issues that a site might
want to consider in creating a computer security policy and setting
procedures to implement that policy.  In some cases, possible options
are discussed along with the some of the ramifications of those
choices.  As far as possible, this document tries not to dictate the
choices a site should make, since these depend on local
circumstances.  Some of the issues brought up may not apply to all
sites.  Nonetheless, all sites should at least consider the issues
brought up here to ensure that they do not miss some important area.

The overall flow of the document is to discuss policy issues followed
by the issues that come up in creating procedures to implement the
policies.

Section 2 discusses setting official site policies for access to
computing resources.  It also goes into the issue of what happens
when the policy is violated.  The policies will drive the procedures
that need to be created, so decision makers will need to make choices
about policies before many of the procedural issues in following
sections can be dealt with.  A key part of creating policies is doing
some kind of risk assessment to decide what really needs to be
protected and the level of resources that should be applied to
protect them.

Once policies are in place, procedures to prevent future security
problems should be established.  Section 3 defines and suggests
actions to take when unauthorized activity is suspected.  Resources
to prevent secruity breaches are also discussed.

Section 4 discusses types of procedures to prevent security problems.
Prevention is a key to security; as an example, the Computer
Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) at Carnegie-
Mellon University (CMU) estimates that 80% or more of the problems
they see have to do with poorly chosen passwords.

Section 5 discusses incident handling: what kinds of issues does a
site face when someone violates the security policy.  Many decisions
will have to made on the spot as the incident occurs, but many of the
options and issues can be discussed in advance.  At very least,
responsibilities and methods of communication can be established
before an incident.  Again, the choices here are influenced by the
policies discussed in section 2.

Section 6 deals with what happens after a security violation has been
dealt with.  Security planning is an on-going cycle; just after an
incident has occurred is an excellent opportunity to improve policies
and procedures.

The rest of the document provides references and an annotated
bibliography.
