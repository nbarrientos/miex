 Metadata and Information Extractor from small XML documents.
 v0.1

OVERVIEW

 The aim of MIEX (Metadata and Information Extractor from small XML
 documents) is to create a wrapper for the Stanford Parser, developed
 by The Stanford Natural Language Processing Group, to extract and
 store metadata (syntactic structures, relationships among words...)
 from simple XML documents in order to apply IR methodologies to
 retrieve useful information afterwards. 

 MIEX is being developed as my final year project at the University of
 Oviedo. This application analyses a batch of XML documents and
 navigates through Stanford Parser's output trees to store all the
 extracted semantic information into a MySQL database.
